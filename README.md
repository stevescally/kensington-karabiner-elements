# Overview

## Kensington ProFit Vertical Track Ball

Using karabiner I wanted to setup custom options for buttons 4,5,6,7 on the
mouse. While karabiner-elements lists (32) total buttons I was only able to
determine the responses for buttons 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 through karabiner-eventviewer.

Paired with the Keychron K3 V2 the following features are in my first
iteration.

1. Switch spaces left(5) and right(4)
2. Volume up(7) down(6)
